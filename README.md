# DoubtBuddy24x7
DotSlash 6.0 Hackathon - DoubtBuddy24x7


# Existing Problem
Developers are unable to find the right person who can personally review their code and pinpoint errors or provide personalized assistance; they only have access to general support. Additionally, there is currently no platform where their debugging or error-solving skills can be validated and tested, and where they can obtain proof of their proficiency.


# Project Description:
DoubtBuddy24x7 is an innovative platform designed to facilitate collaborative problem-solving in the coding community. The system acts as a centralized hub where our platform matches the right error solver(user) for the doubt askers(user). It leverages a unique rating system based on their doubt-askerâ€™s reviews, offering a transparent reflection of an individual's error-solving skills.


# System WorkFlow:
1. Users register and create profiles using their existing linkedin profiles, specifying their tech stack and expertise.
2. Users submit their coding doubts, detailing the issue and tech stack.
3. NLP based algorithms analyze the tech stack and recommend potential doubt solvers.
4. Doubt solvers receive notifications (in case of offline), and upon acceptance (in case of online), a real-time video conference is initiated with screen-sharing capabilities.
5. After the meeting, the doubt asker rates and provides feedback on the doubt solver.
6. The platform collects user interaction data for analytics, refining the recommendation algorithm and optimizing system performance.


# Higher Level Functionality
1. ### User Registration and Profile Creation:
   - Users register on the platform providing necessary linkedin profile details.
   - Users set up their profiles, including their areas of specialization within the tech stack.


2. ### Tech Stack Input:
   - Users enter their current tech stack and brief description about specific issue or doubt they are facing in their code.


3. ### Recommendation Algorithm:
   - Utilize NLP algorithms to analyze the tech stack and match the user with potential problem solvers.
   - Consider factors like expertise, ratings, and availability in making recommendations.


4. ### Notification and Connection:
   - Notify the recommended problem solver about the doubt via the email if he/she is not available.
   - After finding a capable problem solver, Connection has been made to the doubt asker.


5. ### Real-time Communication:
   - Facilitate real-time communication between the doubt asker and the doubt solver.
   - Implement a video conferencing feature for interactive discussions.
   - Include screen-sharing capabilities to assist in debugging and problem-solving.


6. ### Post-Meeting Review and Feedback:
   - After the meeting, the doubt asker submits a review of the doubt solver, rating them on a scale or providing specific feedback.
   - Accumulate and display the ratings on the doubt solver's profile.


7. ### Profile Management:
   - Maintain and update user profiles with relevant information, including experience, expertise, and ratings.
   - Provide features for users to update automatically about their availability and tech stack as they progress in their career.


8. ### User Analytics:
    - Collect data on user interactions, successful doubt resolutions, and user feedback to continually enhance the recommendation algorithm.


9. ### Security and Privacy:
    - Ensure robust security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy during video conferencing.
    - Functionality of report user is there to ensure privacy and security concern.


10. ### User Support:
    - Provide a support system for users facing technical difficulties on the platform.


11. ### Scalability:
    - Design the system to handle a growing user base by ensuring scalability and optimizing resource usage.
